                       Athlete Talk is a mental health web application targeting todays collegate athletes. I was commissoned to bring the mock-up to life as an MVP for J12 Designs 
                       who is a partner to the Athlete Talk Organization. The application was built for internal usage only during the beta phase with the potential for mass release in the 
                       near future. 
                       <br>
                       For more information on MVP development please email JM at narvaez.jonmichael@gmail.com
